            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            Since COVID-19 has hit, the sports industry has changed drastically. Many basketball fans weren't able to keep up with
            the basketball stats that they normally due because of the pandemic. To address this issue and give basketball fans a
            place to have all of this information already in one place, and have it be customizable, we have developed a web
            application that provides all relevant information from the Bubble as well as the ability to customize this space with
            other teams, players, and statistics.
