# Basketball Statistics and the NBA Bubble
## Description 
---
Since COVID-19 has hit, the sports industry has changed drastically. Many basketball fans weren't able to keep up with the basketball stats that they normally due because of the pandemic. To address this issue and give basketball fans a place to have all of this information already in one place, and have it be customizable, we have developed a web application that provides all relevant information from the Bubble as well as the ability to customize this space with other teams, players, and statistics.
